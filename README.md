Module 11 Challenge - Mars

**Background**
You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

**What You're Creating**
This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:
•	Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
•	Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

#### Minimum Temperature

Comparative to Earth, Mars is quite cold. Using averages, we calculated the third month has the coldest temperature on Mars, while the eighth month had the warmets.

#### Atmospheric Pressure

On average, atomospheric pressire is lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth month. 

#### Year Length

Using online resources, we find that one year on Mars equates to about 687 days, nearly 88% more days than Earth!
